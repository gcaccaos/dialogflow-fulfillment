*dialogflow-fulfillment* is a package for Python that helps developers to
create webhook services for Dialogflow.

The package provides an API for creating and manipulating response messages,
output contexts and follow-up events in conversations.

## A simple example

```python
from dialogflow_fulfillment import QuickReplies, WebhookClient


# Define a custom handler function
def handler(agent: WebhookClient) -> None:
    """
    This handler sends a text message along with a quick replies message
    back to Dialogflow, which uses the messages to build the final response
    to the user.
    """
    agent.add('How are you feeling today?')
    agent.add(QuickReplies(quick_replies=['Happy :)', 'Sad :(']))


# Create an instance of the WebhookClient
agent = WebhookClient(request)

# Handle the request using the handler function
agent.handle_request(handler)

# Get the response
response = agent.response
```
